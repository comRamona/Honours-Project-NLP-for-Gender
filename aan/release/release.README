2. FILES INCLUDED

All the statistics and metadata are stored in release/2014/ The 
exact command used for creating the statistics is also mentioned 
below. More details about the scripts and how to use them is 
given in Section 3.

acl-metadata.txt                
Contains the metadata associated with each paper id. The metadata 
associated  with every paper consists of the paper id, title, 
year, venue. 

acl.txt 
This is the paper citation network formatted as 
"paper_id1 ==> paper_id2". 
This file consists of all the citations in AAN.

The above two files are the only canonical files. From the above 
two files, we have created the different networks and statistics 
using in-house scripts.

computed using the author citation network.

COMMAND: bin/aan_pageranks.pl -input="acit"

There are five different networks stored in /release/2011/networks/

1. paper-citation-network.txt       
Paper Citation Network

COMMAND: bin/aan_make_paper_citations.pl

2. paper-citation-network-nonself.txt 
Paper Citation Network excluding self citations

COMMAND: bin/aan_make_paper_citations.pl --nonself

3. author-citation-network.txt      
Author Citation Network

COMMAND: bin/aan_make_author_citation.pl

4. author-citation-network-nonself.txt 
Author Citation Network excluding self citations

COMMAND: bin/aan_make_author_citation.pl -nonself

5. author-collaboration-network.txt 
Author Collaboration Network

COMMAND: bin/aan_make_author_collaboration.pl 

All the networks are formatted using the Edgelist format, which lists
a single edge per line. An edge is formatted as 
"Node1_label ==> Node2_label".

The AAN corpus includes five networks, paper citation, paper citation
network without self citations, author citation, author citation
network without self citations and author collaboration.  The paper
citation network (paper-citation-network.txt) is a directed network
composed of nodes labeled with paper ids which correspond to
individual papers (acl-metadata.txt).  The author citation network
(author-citation-network.txt), a directed network, is compiled from
the paper network and the metadata file.  For each citation in the
paper network, where paper A cites paper B, and for each author in
paper A, an edge is created for that author to each author in paper B.
Both the paper citation network and the author citation network have a
nonself version, i.e, the self citations are excluded. If paper A
cites paper B and there is a common author between the two papers,
then this citation is termed as a self citation.  The author
collaboration network (author-collaboration-network.txt), an
undirected network, is composed of authors where, for each paper
in the paper citation network, an edge is created between each
collaborator for that paper.

------------------------------

4. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The whole release is packaged together as aanrelease2011.tar.gz. First 
untar the release. Let the release be untarred in a directory which 
we will refer to as $HOME

The release comes with a set of scripts that can be used to process the data.
The scripts can be found under the bin subdirectory. All the scripts are in 
Perl and will work perfectly mostly out of the box.

The Perl scripts assume that Perl is installed in /usr/local/bin/ 

If this is not the case, then change the first line of the Perl scripts
to the directory where Perl is installed.

The aan_network_stats.pl makes use of scripts in clairlib (www.clairlib.org). To get 
aan_network_stats.pl working, you need to install clairlib, which can 
be found www.clairlib.org. The website also contains installation 
instructions for installing clairlib. Suppose clairlib is installed in
$CLAIRLIB_HOME, then you need to add the lib directory of clairlib to 
PERL5LIB variable as

$HOME>PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:$CLAIRLIB_HOME/lib

Once this is done, all the scripts should work perfectly as shown in 
the examples.

-----------------------------

5. KNOWN ISSUES

There are some minor issues with the AAN data, specifically paper IDs and 
author names. The most updated and correct release is the 2012 release. 
Specifically, we have merged some duplicate authors in the 2011 release 
for the 2012 release. Also, due to changes in the parent data stored in 
aclweb.org, we  have mapped paper ids W04-99** to W04-32**. Therefore, 
you will find W04-99**'s text in the fulltext directory but they truly 
correspond to W04-32**'s fulltext.

-----------------------------

6. ABOUT THE PROJECT

The ACL Anthology Network was built from the original pdf files
available from the ACL Anthology (http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/) as it
stood in July 2011. Using open source OCR technologies, in-house
clean-up scripts, and often tedious manual labor, a web interface was
developed that allowed for the annotation of individual references
from each paper. A team of student research assistants manually
matched references to existing ACL ID's returned using a keyword
matching algorithm. Those citations deemed to refer to ACL papers but
which were not automatically matched were marked for post-processing.
Using this paper-id network (paper-citation-network) and the metadata
(acl-metadata), the author citation and author collaboration networks
were then created.
