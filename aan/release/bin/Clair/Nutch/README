Author: afader

Summary
----------
SimpleSearch is a very simple Nutch query interface. It takes a query, an
index directory, and an optional maximum number of hits to retrieve and 
prints the results of the query to standard output. The results of the query 
are the key and value pairs found in the HitDetails object (see the Nutch
API docs for more information about this).

Installation
----------
To install SimpleSearch, drop it into the $NUTCH_HOME/lib directory.

Usage
----------
SimpleSearch is executed through the $NUTCH_HOME/bin/nutch script. Run:

    $NUTCH_HOME/bin/nutch edu.umich.si.clair.nutch.SimpleSearch \
        dir query [numhits]

where "dir" is a Nutch index directory (you can identify this directory
because it will contain the segments and db subdirectories), "query" is the
text query (make sure to enclose multiple words in quotes), and "numhits"
is the maximum number of hits to return (this is optional).
